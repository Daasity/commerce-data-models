# Commerce Data Models
# ðŸ“£ What is the purpose of this Commerce Data Model?
The Unified Order Schema (UOS) is a data model initially designed by the Daasity(http://www.daasity.com) team that helps accelerate development of analytical capability by normalizing all commerce data: eCommerce, Marketplace, Retail and Wholesale. The normalized schema was designed to support complex fulfillment logic like split shipments and multiple delivery groups and be extensible for edge cases like product customization or personalization.
UOS is split into core tables, required to support an order across multiple commerce channels, and secondary tables that are required to provide functionality to the business. Core tables are built off the concepts of Customer, Product, Order, Fulfillment and Location which all required components of a consumer product purchase.
For product, Brands will use different naming conventions for their merchandising hierarchy from Class, Category, Sub-Category to Style or Product (which can have different meaning) and Item or SKU. This Commerce schema limits tables to Product (want some might call a Style) and Product Variant (what some might call an Item or SKU)

# Unified Order Schema (UOS)
This section provides a detailed description of the Unified Order Schema (UOS) and defines each table and column in this schema.

## Overview
The Unified Order Schema (UOS) is a core data model within the Daasity transformation module that helps accelerate development of analytical capability by normalizing all commerce data: eCommerce, Marketplace, Retail and Wholesale. The normalized schema was designed to support complex fulfillment logic like split shipments and multiple delivery groups and be extensible for edge cases like product customization or personalization.
UOS is split into what we consider core tables, required to support an order across multiple commerce channels, and secondary tables that are required to provide functionality to the business. Core tables are built off the concepts of Customer, Product, Order, Fulfillment and Location which all required components of a consumer product purchase.
For product, Brands will use different naming conventions for their merchandising hierarchy from Class, Category, Sub-Category to Style or Product (which can have different meaning) and Item or SKU. Weâ€™ve taken the Shopify approach and label tables as Product (want some might call a Style) and Product Variant (what some might call an Item or SKU)

>[!TIP]
> Many of the tables contain the following fields which can be used to track the data flow from the source system to the integration schema within the database and then to UOS, our normalized order schema
>__loaded_at: defines when the record was last loaded into this table
>__synced_at: defines when the record was last replicated from the source system into the integration tables
>__shop_id: defines which integration the data was replicated from (this value is from the source itself)
>__uos_integration_id: the ID of the integration within the Daasity platform
>__uos_source: the general source of the data (Shopify, Amazon, Magento, etc._)h

>[!NOTE]
> We define tables with three different types:
>Core - you need to populate this table if you want to have a well-defined order model even if the source data is not structured this way which is especially true for Amazon
>Householding - these tables are important to enable customer house-holding
>Secondary - these tables are nice to have for proper Customer/Order analytics
